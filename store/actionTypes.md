# Documentation for `actionTypes.js` 📄

Welcome to the documentation for the `actionTypes.js` file. This file is a crucial part of our application, especially if you're working with Redux, as it defines the action types used across different parts of the application. By defining action types as constants, the codebase becomes more manageable and reduces the risk of typos and errors when dispatching actions.

## Purpose 🎯

The primary purpose of the `actionTypes.js` file is to centralize the action type constants used in Redux actions and reducers. This centralization helps maintain consistency and makes it easier to manage and refactor code. 

## Action Types Description 📜

Below is a table summarizing the action types defined in this file:

| Constant Name      | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LOGGED_IN_USER`   | Represents the action type for a user that has logged in.        |
| `LOGIN_USER`       | Represents the action type for initiating a login process.       |
| `LOGIN_SUCCESS`    | Represents the action type for a successful login operation.     |
| `LOGOUT_USER`      | Represents the action type for logging out a user from the app.  |

## Code Breakdown 🛠️

Let's take a closer look at the code snippet from `actionTypes.js`:

```javascript
export const LOGGED_IN_USER = "LOGGED_IN_USER";
export const LOGIN_USER = "LOGIN_USER";
export const LOGIN_SUCCESS = "LOGIN_SUCCESS";
export const LOGOUT_USER = "LOGOUT_USER";
```

- **Exporting Constants**: Each constant is exported using the `export` keyword, which makes them available for import in other files. This is crucial as these constants will be used in action creators and reducers to represent specific actions.

- **Defining Action Types**: Each string value assigned to the constant is a unique identifier for an action. This ensures that actions are dispatched and handled correctly, enabling predictable state transitions in the Redux store.

## Usage Examples 🚀

### In Actions File

In a typical Redux setup, you would use these action types in an actions file like so:

```javascript
import { LOGIN_USER, LOGIN_SUCCESS, LOGOUT_USER } from './actionTypes';

export const loginUser = (userData) => ({
  type: LOGIN_USER,
  payload: userData
});

export const loginSuccess = (userData) => ({
  type: LOGIN_SUCCESS,
  payload: userData
});

export const logoutUser = () => ({
  type: LOGOUT_USER
});
```

### In Reducers File

Similarly, these action types are used in reducers to determine how the application state should change:

```javascript
import { LOGIN_USER, LOGIN_SUCCESS, LOGOUT_USER } from './actionTypes';

const initialState = {
  user: null,
  isLoggedIn: false
};

const authReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOGIN_USER:
      // handle login logic
      return { ...state, user: action.payload };

    case LOGIN_SUCCESS:
      return { ...state, isLoggedIn: true };

    case LOGOUT_USER:
      return { ...state, user: null, isLoggedIn: false };

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## Conclusion 🎉

The `actionTypes.js` file is a foundational component of our application’s Redux architecture. By maintaining these action types in a single, centralized file, we create a more robust and error-resistant codebase. As the project grows, this approach will facilitate easier maintenance and scalability.
