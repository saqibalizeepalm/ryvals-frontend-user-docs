## Overview

The `CorporateBusiness.jsx` file is responsible for setting up a corporate business webpage with various sections like a header, slider, services, team, about, pricing, and more. It leverages several React components to build a modular and reusable UI.

## Imports

The file imports a variety of components and libraries to support its functionality:

- **React Components**: Importing from React and custom components from the project.
- **Modal and Slider**: `react-modal-video` and `react-slick` for enhanced UI interactions.
- **Icons**: From `react-icons/fi` for using Feather icons.
- **Content Components**: Such as `BlogContent`, `Team`, `CounterOne`, and others for dynamic content display.

```jsx
import React, { Component, Fragment } from 'react';
import ModalVideo from 'react-modal-video';
import ScrollToTop from 'react-scroll-up';
import Slider from 'react-slick';
import { slideSlick } from '../page-demo/script';
import BlogContent from '../elements/blog/BlogContent';
import Header from '../component/header/HeaderFive';
import FooterTwo from '../component/footer/FooterTwo';
import CallAction from '../elements/callaction/CallAction';
import Team from '../blocks/team/TeamTwo';
import Accordion01 from '../elements/Accordion';
import Helmet from '../component/common/Helmet';
import {
  FiCast,
  FiLayers,
  FiUsers,
  FiChevronUp,
  FiCheck,
} from 'react-icons/fi';
import CounterOne from '../elements/counters/CounterOne';
import BrandOne from '../elements/Brand';
```

## Components and State

The core class component `CorporateBusiness` extends `React.Component` and manages its state with the following properties:

- **isOpen**: A boolean to control the modal video state.

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the state and binds methods to the component context.

```jsx
constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { isOpen: false };
    this.openModal = this.openModal.bind(this);
}
```

### openModal Method

A method to set the state of `isOpen` to true, which is used to open a video modal.

```jsx
openModal() {
    this.setState({ isOpen: true });
}
```

## Render Method

The main `render` method is responsible for composing the UI by using various components and passing necessary props.

```jsx
render() {
    ...
    return (
        <Fragment>
            <Helmet pageTitle="Corporate Business" />
            <Header headerPosition="header--static logoresize" logo="all-dark" color="color-black"/>
            {/* Start Slider Area */}
            <div className="slider-wrapper">
                ...
            </div>
            {/* End Slider Area */}
            {/* Start Service Area */}
            <div className="service-area ptb--30 bg_color--1">
                ...
            </div>
            {/* End Service Area */}
            {/* Start Team Area */}
            <div className="rn-team-area ptb--120 bg_color--1">
                ...
            </div>
            {/* End Team Area */}
            <FooterTwo />
            <div className="backto-top">
                <ScrollToTop showUnder={160}>
                    <FiChevronUp />
                </ScrollToTop>
            </div>
        </Fragment>
    );
