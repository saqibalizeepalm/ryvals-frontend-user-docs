## Introduction

These components are designed to serve as the footer sections of a web application. They incorporate social media links, structured layouts, and quick links to other parts of the website. The components are styled using classes that imply the usage of CSS or a preprocessor like SASS for styling.

## Footer.jsx Component

### Purpose of `Footer.jsx`

The `Footer.jsx` component provides a footer with **calls to action**, **quick links**, **contact information**, and **social media links**. It is structured to encourage users to reach out or explore more about the website and its offerings.

### Component Structure `Footer.jsx`

```javascript
class Footer extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <React.Fragment>

                    <div className="footer-wrapper">
                        <div className="row align-items-end row--0">
                            ...

## FooterTwo.jsx Component

### Purpose of `FooterTwo.jsx`

The `FooterTwo.jsx` component provides a more compact and visually distinct footer design. It focuses on branding, social media interaction, and a copyright notice.

### Component Structure `FooterTwo.jsx`

```javascript
const FooterTwo = () => {
    return (
        <div className="footer-style-2 ptb--30 bg_image bg_image--1" data-black-overlay="6">
            <div className="wrapper plr--50 plr_sm--20">
                <div className="row align-items-center justify-content-between">
                    ...
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

#### Key Parts:

- **`footer-style-2` & `bg_image`**: These style the background and overall appearance.
- **Logo Section**: Contains a logo that links to the home page.
- **Social Media Section**: Centrally aligned social media icons.
- **Copyright Section**: Aligns the copyright message to the right.

### Features `FooterTwo.jsx`

- **Logo**: Image linking to the homepage for brand recognition.
- **Social Media**:
  - Facebook
  - LinkedIn
  - Instagram

## Social Media Icons

Both components use the `react-icons` library to render social media icons. This library allows for easy integration of icon sets in React applications. The icons included are:

- **Facebook**: `FaFacebookF`
- **LinkedIn**: `FaLinkedinIn`
- **Instagram**: `FaInstagram`
- **Twitter**: `FaTwitter`

### Social Media Structure

```javascript
const SocialShare = [
    { Social: <FaFacebookF />, link: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },
    { Social: <FaLinkedinIn />, link: 'https://www.linkedin.com/' },
    { Social: <FaInstagram />, link: 'https://www.instagram.com/' },
    { Social: <FaTwitter />, link: 'https://twitter.com/' },
]
```

Each object in the `SocialShare` array holds an icon component and a URL link to the respective social media profile.

## Conclusion

These components, `Footer.jsx` and `FooterTwo.jsx`, are designed to enhance the user experience by providing navigational aids and social media connectivity. They are styled using responsive classes and incorporate interactive elements to encourage user engagement. By understanding these components, developers can effectively integrate them into their projects for a polished and functional footer section.
