## üïπÔ∏è GamesList Component

### Overview

The **GamesList** component is a class-based component that fetches and displays a list of games. It uses the `GameCard` component to represent each game.

### State Management

The component utilizes `state` to manage:

- **games**: An array of game objects fetched from a service.
- **player_ip**: The IP address of the player, fetched from an external library.
- **isLoading**: A boolean flag to indicate if data is currently being loaded.

### Lifecycle Methods

- **`componentDidMount()`**: 
  - Fetches the list of games using the `gamelisting` service.
  - Sets up event listeners for storage events to handle logouts.
  - Fetches the player's IP address using the `public-ip` library.

### Rendering and UI

The component employs:

- **Parallax Effect**: Adds depth to the game banner using the `react-parallax` library.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displays a loading spinner while fetching data.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap classes for a responsive layout.

### Usage

```jsx
<GamesList />
```

### Key Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves data from a remote source to populate the games list.
- **Player IP Tracking**: Retrieves and stores the player's public IP address.
- **Responsive Slider**: Although commented out, the component has settings for a responsive slider using potential libraries.
